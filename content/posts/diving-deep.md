As a computer science undergraduate, I have always been fascinated by the power of machine learning to solve complex problems. Recently, I have become particularly interested in deep learning and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on various tasks, such as image and language processing.

That's why I am excited to announce that I am starting the "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" course from fast.ai, teached by Jeremy Howard. Through this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of deep learning and how to apply it in practice.

I will be learning about different types of neural networks, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, as well as techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize them. There are also numerous tools and frameworks available for building deep learning models, like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, which make it easier for those with limited experience to build and train these models.

In addition to learning about deep learning, I also want to improve my writing skills. That's why I am starting a technical blog to document my journey in deep learning and provide a platform for me to practice and improve my writing skills.

I am looking forward to the challenges and rewards that this journey will bring, and I am confident that my deep learning skills and improved writing skills will be valuable in my future career as a computer science professional. I can't wait to dive into the world of deep learning!
