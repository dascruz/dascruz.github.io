Recently, I have become particularly interested in deep learning and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on various tasks, such as image and language processing.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I am excited to announce that I am starting the &amp;ldquo;Practical Deep Learning for Coders&amp;rdquo; course from fast.ai, teached by Jeremy Howard. Through this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of deep learning and how to apply it in practice.</description></item></channel></rss>
